    <h3>The Basics</h3>
    <p>
      The Pomodoro technique is a time-management strategy where, for 25 minutes at a time, you focus solely on a task
      you need to get done, with nothing to interrupt you.
      A 5 minute break, where one can use one's phone, or derp around on the intertent, is generally allotted between
      intervals. Working in this way helps with productivity while effectively reducing burn-out.

    <h3>The Advanceds</h3>
    <p>
      One does not do a single pomodoro, but typically multiple ones that accumulate throughout the day. <i>Eat
      Tomatoes</i> automatically keeps track of the pomodoros completed and the breaks taken, keeping you on top of your
      productivity game.

      The tomat-o-meter is your guide to productivity throughout the day. It's now easy to recall how many pomodoro's you've completed vs how many breaks you've been taking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your tomat-o-meter automatically resets at the end of the day. If you connected your Google account, a history of your tomat-o-meters will be kept for you.
